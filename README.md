# awesome-github-profile-pages

Hey there,
If you have come across to this repo so you definitely wants to create an awesome profile page and you don't have enough time to create simple website or not interested in doing HTML stuff then you are probably at the right place.   

## Resume is dead 

A good Github profile can both make you more likely to pass resume screening and impress the interviewer. For both recruiters and interviewers, it’s very important to know what each candidate has been working and what's their contributions to the open source community. we all know that resume becomes less and less valuable because people tend to exaggerate their past contributions/skills and it’s extremely hard to verify. Some people may even fake their resumes.(grand salutes to those extraordinary peoples)

However only few candidates have a Github page on their resumes and most of them are not well maintained. So you definitely get better chance to stand out by keeping an up-to-date Github profile. By looking at one’s Github repositories, you can almost immediately tell if he’s an expert or beginner of a specific field.
